I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk/) at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/), advised by [Prof. Akhil Arora](https://au-clan.github.io/people/aarora/). My research focuses on efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning.

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Data Science and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). During my master's thesis at [DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch/), I introduced *Fleet of Agents*, a framework utilizing LLMs as agents for coordinated problem solving, receiving a perfect grade of 6/6 (top 1%).

I have also worked as a Schuman Trainee at the AI unit of the **European Parliament** and as a Data Science Intern at **Prediggo SA**.
